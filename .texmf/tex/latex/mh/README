The files in the mh bundle are:
    breqn.dtx
    flexisym.dtx
    mathstyle.dtx
    mhsetup.dtx
    mathtools.dtx
    empheq.dtx
    breqn-technotes.tex
and derived files. The derived files of each .dtx-file are listed
at the top of the respective .dtx-file.


INSTALLATION
============
Running TeX on each dtx file extracts the runtime files. See the dtx
files for details.

DESCRIPTION
===========

breqn
=====

The breqn package facilitates automatic line-breaking of displayed
math expressions. The package was originally developed by Michael
J. Downes.

flexisym
========

This package turns math symbols into macros.
Is is required by breqn so that breqn can make intelligent decisions
with respect to line-breaking and other details.

mathstyle
=========

Ensures uniform syntax for math subscript (_) and superscript (^)
operations so that they always take exactly one argument.
Grants access to the current mathstyle which eases several tasks such
as avoiding the many pitfalls of \mathchoice and \mathpalette.
This package is used by flexisym.

mathtools
=========

The mathtools package provides many useful tools for mathematical
typesetting. It is based on amsmath and fixes various deficiencies
of amsmath and standard LaTeX. It provides:
  -- Extensible symbols, such as brackets, arrows, harpoons, etc.
  -- Various symbols such as \coloneqq (:=).
  -- Easy creation of new tag forms.
  -- Showing only the referenced equations.
  -- Extensible arrows, harpoons and hookarrows.
  -- Starred versions of the amsmath matrix environments for
     specifying the column alignment.
  -- More building blocks: multlined, cases-like environments, new
     gathered environments.
  -- Math versions of \makebox, \llap, \rlap etc.
  -- Cramped math styles.
  -- and more...

mathtools requires mhsetup.

empheq
======

The empheq package is a visual markup extension designed to
function on top of amsmath. It features:
  -- Boxing multi line math displays while leaving equation
     numbers untouched at the margin. Any kind of box will do.
  -- Making the ntheorem package place end-of-theorem markers
     perfectly.
  -- Placing arbitrary material on either side of math displays.
     This includes delimiters that automatically scale to the
     correct size.

empheq requires mathtools.


mhsetup
=======

The mhsetup package defines various programming tools needed by
both empheq and mathtools. In the future, most of these tools will
probably be an integral part of LaTeX3.

xfrac
=====

A package for producing split level fractions in both text and
math. This package started as a part of the MH bundle, but is not
integrated into the l3packages bundle.
